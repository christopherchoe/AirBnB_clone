						BRUH! Respect. You. You're something else. Do you want to disorient Athena? Take Samie's Spot for a day, or a week, or however long you can afford to bruh...! If you don't he will END YOU, the book is closed, the computer shutdown, the bread toasted, the microwave beeped, the panini pressed, etc. If he damns make sure to son. There will be one bedroom which you can join Samie in and there is room for one special guest. Always down for a drink, happy hour or not. If you want to take the elevator to the top floor he will get up high with you too. Don't stress about the bathroom nobody is getting dirty here. As the assistant, intern, mangager, executive, vice president, president, friend of a friend of the CEO, CTO, Council, Board member, Head of the President of this bowling alley, Samie will ask you to get your head out of the gutter. Or he will ask you to leave. So remember bruh, Respect!
